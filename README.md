# Learning FastAPI

This repository documents my projects, notes, and experiments as I dive into learning FastAPI. I am challenging myself to learn it as fast as I can and Iâ€™m sharing my progress on X at [@mmlouamri](https://x.com/mmlouamri). Follow me to stay updated, or drop me a DM if you have suggestions!
