# Learning FastAPI

This repository documents my projects, notes, and experiments as I dive into learning FastAPI. I am challenging myself to learn it as fast as I can and Iâ€™m sharing my progress on X at @mmlouamri. Follow me to stay updated, or drop me a DM if you have suggestions!

## Timeline
- **Day 1**: Query and Path Parameters, Parameters Validation, Error Handling, and Response Type.
